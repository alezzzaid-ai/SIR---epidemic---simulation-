# SIR Epidemic Simulation with Machine Learning

This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using the classic
SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model and applies a simple machine learning
approach to analyze infection trends.

## Features
- SIR epidemic simulation
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Linear regression to model infection trends
- Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## What this project demonstrates
- Translating mathematical models into working code
- Simulating dynamic systems over time
- Visualizing data to understand patterns
- Applying basic machine learning concepts
- Evaluating model performance

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python epidemic_ml_project.py
